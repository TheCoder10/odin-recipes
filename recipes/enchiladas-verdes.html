    <h3>Making the sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place the tomatillos and garlic cloves in a pot and cover with water.<br>
                 Place over medium-high heat until it comes to a boil.<br>
                 Simmer on medium heat for about 10 minutes, or until tomatillos 
                 change<br> their color from bright to pale green, are cooked through, 
                 and are soft but not coming apart.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            &nbsp;
            <li>Place the tomatillos, garlic and 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid in the blender and puree.<br> 
                Add the chiles serranos, cilantro leaves, onion and salt, and puree again until smooth.<br>
                 Heat a tablespoon of oil in a pot over medium-high heat.<br> Once it is hot, but not smoking, pour in the sauce and bring to a simmer. 
                 Let it simmer over medium heat for about <br>6 minutes, until it thickens and deepens in color.
                 Taste for salt and add more if need be.
            </li>
        </ol>

    <h3>Making the Enchiladas</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large saute pan over medium heat, add enough oil to have about 1/2 inch depth.<br> 
                Let it heat about 3 minutes. Gently "pass each tortilla through the oil," one by one,<br>
                 for about 15 seconds on each side, they will soften and become resilient. 
                 You should be able to fold them without breaking them. 
                Transfer them to a paper towel covered plate.</li>
                &nbsp;
                &nbsp;
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                Place about 2 to 3 tablespoons chicken inside of each tortilla and roll them up.<br> 
                Place them, seam side down on a baking dish. Cover, generously, with the green sauce.<br>
                 Place them in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes.<br>
                  Remove them from the oven, sprinkle with the crumbled cheese, the cream, 
                  and the chopped onion.<br> They are very satisfying with a side of rice and/or beans,
                 as well as with a light green salad.
            </li>
        </ol>
