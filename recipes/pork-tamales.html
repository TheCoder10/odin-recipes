    <p>Pork Tamales can be <em>a bit</em> of a lengthy process, but are a <strong>highly</strong> rewarding and <i>delicious</i> recipe and also not too difficult!</p>
    <sub><sub>So lets start off with our ingredients</sub></sub>
    <hr>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>7-8 pounds pork butt or pork shoulder</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sea salt</li>
            <li>6 1/2 cups Red Chile Sauce</li>
            <li>1 Batch Tamale Masa</li>
            <li>Corn husks, hojas</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        
        <hr>
            <h4>Shredded pork</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place pork, water, and salt in a slow cooker and cook for 6 to 8 hours.<br>After meat is cooked, remove from the slow cooker and let cool to room temperature.<br>
                 Shred pork and remove fat while shredding, reserving fat.<br> (Usually, after pork is cooked and shredded, you will be left with about 3 pounds of meat.)
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                In a blender combine the cooled broth from the cooked pork and the leftover fat pieces.<br> Blend and reserve for using when making tamale masa and filling.<br>
                 Broth can be kept, tightly covered, for 1 week in the refrigerator.<br> The broth also freezes well and will keep for 4 to 6 months.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <hr>
            <h4>Filling</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat the 6 tablespoons broth in a large skillet.<br> Add flour and whisk for at least 4 to 5 minutes.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                Add red chile sauce and salt, stir, and cook for 10 minutes.<br> The chile sauce will be very thick at this time.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                Add the 3 pounds shredded pork and stir so all the pork is well coated with the red chile sauce. Simmer for at least 10 minutes.<br> Let mixture cool before filling tamales.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <hr>
            <h4>Prepare Husks</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Soak corn husks in water for an hour before using, rinse well with running water to take off any dust or corn husk fibers<br>
                 To keep corn husks pliable and easy to work with, keep in water while filling tamales.<br> Place a handful of wet corn husks in a colander to drain before using.
        </ol>
                <hr>
            <h4>Spread Masa</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the wide end of the husk on the palm of your hand, narrow end is at the top.<br> Starting at the middle of the husk spread 2 tablespoons of 
                the masa with the back of a spoon in a rectangle or oval shape, using a downward motion towards the wide-bottom edge.<br> 
                Do not spread the masa to the ends; leave about a 2-inch border on the left and right sides of the husk.
        </ol>
                        <hr>
            <h4>Fill Husks</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Spoon 1 1/2 tablespoons of your chosen filling down the center of the masa.<br>Fold both sides to the center; 
                finish off by bringing the pointed end of the husk toward the filled end.<br>
                 Make sure itâ€™s a snug closure so the tamal will not open during steaming. Secure by tying a thin strip of corn husk around the tamal.<br>
                 This will keep the tamal from unwrapping during the steaming process, especially if the husk is too thick and will not stay folded.
        </ol>
                        <hr>
            <h4>Steam tamales</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Use a deep pot or tamale steamer to steam tamales. If using a tamale steamer fill with water up to the fill line.<br> Set the tamale rack over the water.
                 Place tamales upright, with fold against the sides of the other tamales to keep them from unfolding.<br> Cover pot with a tightly fitting lid. 
                 Set heat on high and bring to a boil, about 15 minutes. Lower heat and simmer for 2 1/2 to 3 hours.<br>
                 Keep lid on tightly. To test if done, put one tamal on a plate and take off the corn husk. If it comes off without sticking to the tamal they are done.
